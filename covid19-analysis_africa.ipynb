    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This report analyzes global COVID-19 data with a focus on selected African countries: South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe. We explored trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations to understand the impact and progression of the pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Total Cases Over Time\n",
    "South Africa experienced a significant rise in cases from mid-2020, peaking around July. Kenya and Nigeria showed slower case growth. The decline in South Africa's cases in 2021 correlates with the implementation of stricter lockdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Total Deaths and Death Rate\n",
    "South Africa reported the highest total deaths among the four, but its death rate (deaths ÷ cases) was comparatively lower than Nigeria's, suggesting stronger health infrastructure or better access to treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Vaccination Rollout\n",
    "South Africa showed the fastest vaccination rollout, reaching over 50% of its population by early 2022. Kenya and Zimbabwe lagged, with less than 30% vaccinated by the same period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Daily New Cases\n",
    "While South Africa had higher peaks, daily new cases in Kenya and Nigeria showed sporadic increases, possibly due to underreporting or testing issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Geographic Spread (Choropleth)\n",
    "The choropleth map highlights the stark differences in total case distribution globally, with South Africa being the hotspot in Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Insights & Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "- South Africa reported the highest total cases and deaths among the four.\n",
    "- Zimbabwe had fewer reported cases, but data completeness may vary.\n",
    "- Vaccination coverage remained relatively low in Kenya and Nigeria.\n",
    "- Data gaps existed early in the pandemic—interpolation helped smooth trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "This project helped strengthen my data cleaning, visualization, and narrative-building skills. I also practiced interpreting real-world data to derive meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Data shows a clear relationship between vaccination progress and decline in deaths. Countries with higher vaccination rates generally experienced lower fatality trends. Continued efforts in vaccination and healthcare support remain essential.\n",
