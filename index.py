# COVID-19 Data Analysis Report

## Introduction
This report analyzes global COVID-19 data with a focus on selected African countries: South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe. We explored trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations to understand the impact and progression of the pandemic.

## Key Insights

### 1. Total Cases Over Time
South Africa experienced a significant rise in cases from mid-2020, peaking around July. Kenya and Nigeria showed slower case growth. The decline in South Africa's cases in 2021 correlates with the implementation of stricter lockdowns.

### 2. Total Deaths and Death Rate
South Africa reported the highest total deaths among the four, but its death rate (deaths รท cases) was comparatively lower than Nigeria's, suggesting stronger health infrastructure or better access to treatment.

### 3. Vaccination Rollout
South Africa showed the fastest vaccination rollout, reaching over 50% of its population by early 2022. Kenya and Zimbabwe lagged, with less than 30% vaccinated by the same period.

### 4. Daily New Cases
While South Africa had higher peaks, daily new cases in Kenya and Nigeria showed sporadic increases, possibly due to underreporting or testing issues.

### 5. Geographic Spread (Choropleth)
The choropleth map highlights the stark differences in total case distribution globally, with South Africa being the hotspot in Africa.

## Conclusion
Data shows a clear relationship between vaccination progress and decline in deaths. Countries with higher vaccination rates generally experienced lower fatality trends. Continued efforts in vaccination and healthcare support remain essential.
